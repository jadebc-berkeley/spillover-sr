# spillover-sr

This repository contains the scripts for a systematic review of spillover effects of health interventions in low- and middle-income countries. These scripts reproduce tables and figures in an article entitled by Benjamin-Chung et al.:

   Spillover effects on health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review in the *International Journal of Epidemiology* 2017, 1251â€“1276 [doi: 10.1093/ije/dyx039](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/4/1251/3752464). 

`0-reproduce.sh` is a bash script that can be used to reproduce the entire workflow. Script names indicate the table / figure they are associated with. Datasets from this systematic review are publicly available at [https://osf.io/ytx9h/](https://osf.io/ytx9h/).
